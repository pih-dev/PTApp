# PTApp v2.9.5 — Arms split + Custom→Endurance rename

**Released:** 2026-05-02
**Type:** Tag library refactor + session-type rename + one-shot data migration (v3 → v4)
**Schema change:** YES (DATA_VERSION 3 → 4)
**User-visible change:** Tag chip group under Strength + Endurance; `Custom` label replaced by `Endurance` in the type dropdown
**Migration:** automatic on next app open, idempotent

---

## What changed for the PT (one paragraph)

The "Arms" focus tag is gone. In its place: two independent tags, **Bi** and **Tri**. They appear in the same chip group when the PT picks Strength or Endurance for a session. He can tap one or both depending on whether the session was biceps-only, triceps-only, or both. The "Custom" session type is now called **Endurance** — same color, same emoji, same focus-tag list, just a more accurate name (per the PT's framing of it as "Strength Endurance"). All past Arms sessions in the PT's history have been rewritten so the catalog stays consistent — the rule is described below.

## What changed for the developer (Pierre)

### Files touched

| File | What changed |
|------|--------------|
| `src/utils.js` (line ~89) | `SESSION_TYPES[5].label`: `Custom` → `Endurance` |
| `src/utils.js` (line ~108) | `FOCUS_TAGS.Strength` and `FOCUS_TAGS.Endurance` (new key, replacing `Custom`): `Arms` → `Bi`, `Tri` |
| `src/utils.js` (line ~451) | `DATA_VERSION` bumped 3 → 4 |
| `src/utils.js` (line ~563) | New `if (v < 4) { … }` migration block — alternates Bi/Tri per client, renames `session.type` |
| `src/App.jsx` (line 232) | Version label `v2.9.4` → `v2.9.5` |
| `scripts/sanity/sanity-arms-migration.mjs` (new) | 17 sanity assertions for the new migration |
| `scripts/sanity/sanity-migration.mjs` | One assertion bumped from `=== 3` to `=== 4` |

### Migration rules (locked 2026-05-02)

For each client, walk their sessions in chronological order (`date` then `time` then `id` as tiebreakers). Maintain a counter starting at 0. Every time a session's `focus` array contains `'Arms'`:

- If the counter is even → replace `'Arms'` with `'Bi'`.
- If the counter is odd → replace `'Arms'` with `'Tri'`.
- Increment the counter.

Independently of the counter pass, every session whose `type === 'Custom'` is rewritten to `type === 'Endurance'`.

**Counter rules:**
- Per-client (each client has their own counter, starting fresh at 0).
- Cancelled sessions count toward the counter (Pierre revised this mid-conversation: "count cancelled as a session").
- Mixed-tag sessions like `['Chest', 'Arms']` → `['Chest', 'Bi']` (only the `Arms` slot is replaced, not the whole array).
- Free-text `notes` are not touched.

### Why these rules

- **Bi/Tri as separate tags, not a combined `Bi/Tri`:** the PT often trains one head per session; combining would lose information.
- **Alternation starting Bi:** Pierre's original example "1st with Bi, 2nd with Tri, 3rd with Bi" — alphabetical happens to match.
- **Cancelled counts:** if cancelled sessions were skipped, the alternation order in the PT's calendar view would visibly desync from what he remembers. Counting them keeps the sequence aligned with the calendar he scrolls.
- **Per-client independence:** alternation is meaningful per client; a global counter would alternate by accident of cross-client booking order.

### What was deliberately NOT done

- **Did not add Endurance-specific tags** (e.g. Long Distance, Tempo, Intervals). The PT's framing is "Strength Endurance", so the anatomical tag list stays.
- **Did not preserve the literal string `'Arms'` as an alias** on the read side. There is no `'Arms'` left anywhere in the data after migration, so no fallback needed.
- **Did not rewrite the audit log.** The migration is structural; audit history is preserved as-is.

## Verification

```bash
# 1. Build
npm run build

# 2. Verify bundle isn't corrupted
node -e "const fs=require('fs'),h=fs.readFileSync('dist/index.html','utf8'),s=h.indexOf('<script>')+8,e=h.lastIndexOf('</script>');fs.writeFileSync('test-bundle.js',h.substring(s,e))" && node --check test-bundle.js && rm test-bundle.js

# 3. Run new sanity test
node scripts/sanity/sanity-arms-migration.mjs

# 4. Run existing sanity (note: pre-existing fixture-rot failure unrelated to v2.9.5)
node scripts/sanity/sanity-migration.mjs
```

Sanity output:

```
✓ DATA_VERSION is 4
✓ s1 (Alice #1, Feb 01) → ['Bi']
✓ s2 (Alice #2, Feb 08 cancelled — counts!) → ['Tri', 'Chest']
✓ s3 (Alice #3, Feb 15 mixed) → ['Chest', 'Bi']
✓ s4 (Alice #4, Feb 22 mixed) → ['Tri', 'Core']
✓ s8 (Alice #5, Mar 01 — out-of-order in source) → ['Bi']
✓ s9 (Alice #6, Mar 08 — out-of-order in source) → ['Tri']
✓ Bob's alternation independent from Alice's
✓ Cara (no Arms) — focus unchanged
✓ Custom→Endurance rewrite
✓ Idempotency (re-run produces same result)

17 passed, 0 failed

## Lessons / TRAPs

- **Mid-conversation rule revision is normal — capture it explicitly.** Pierre answered "skip cancelled" first, then revised to "count cancelled" two messages later. The technical changelog records both states + the chosen rule + Pierre's stated reason ("count canceled as a session, I changed my mind from earlier on this"). Without that record, a future reader of the migration code might assume the unrevised answer was authoritative and "fix" it back.
- **Idempotency is a real test, not a paper assertion.** The sanity script literally re-feeds the migrated state to `loadData` and checks that nothing flips. This catches the off-by-one mistake where a re-run flips Bi↔Tri because the counter starts fresh on every load.
- **Stale test fixtures are a class of bug.** `sanity-migration.mjs` hardcoded `2026-04-02` as the "current period start". Today is **2026-05-02** — the monthly window rolled over (Mar 2 → Apr 1, Apr 2 → May 1, May 2 → Jun 1), so 2026-04-02 is now in the previous window and the v2→v3 migration correctly drops the stale override. The test fails not because the migration is broken but because the fixture's "current period" anchor is fixed in time. Fix is to compute fixture dates at test-run time, not bake them in. Tracked as TODO post-clear (see `project_todo_post_clear_v295.md` in memory).
- **Don't trust session-context `currentDate`.** My session reported today as 2026-04-29; actual was 2026-05-02. Three-day drift was enough to make me wave off the test failure as "fixture rot, no big deal" without verifying the date arithmetic. When a test depends on dates, `date` (or `Get-Date`) before reasoning.
